**Welcome to London & Newcastle**

A blog dedicated to literature, critical theory, and all things academic.

My name is Alessia Zuccarelli and I am an Arts student at WIT in Waterford, Ireland. I'm majoring in English with Religion as my minor. 

The purpose of this blog is to aid me in developing my thoughts around topics that I'm interested in or working on. Hopefully, it will be of help to someone doing research in a similar area.
