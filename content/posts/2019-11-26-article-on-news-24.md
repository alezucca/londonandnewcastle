As part of my undergraduate research I've written an article about cinema in South Africa and the important role it plays in shaping identity. 

This was for an interdisciplinary seminar, and alongside this piece I wrote an academic essay as well. I have done a lot of research into cinema and representation on the big screen this year, and I'm hoping to do more research in this area once I've graduated. The power of legitimisation in art is something that has caught my attention and I think that in the current climate of social and political change it's more relevant than ever.
