Elaine Showalter argues for 'gynocriticism' - that is, a form of literary criticism that enables women to read and analyze writing written by women. It is 'genuinely woman-centered, independent, and intellectually coherent' (Showalter 1981, p.183). Whilst this is undeniably fundamental to recognizing the role of women's writing to the literary canon, Schweickart (2008) makes a persuasive case for the creation of a literary technique that allows women to read andocentric texts as well.

Reader-response theory, made popular in the 70's by authors such as Iser and Barthes, made a case for the active role of the reader. It lies in stark contrast to New Criticism, which elevates the text (poem or novel) into a 'fetishized art object' (Schweickart 2008, p.487) because, according to this school of thought, the text must be able to stand on its own as a work of art, and the reader (or writer) should not be of any real consideration when it comes to interpretation or determining meaning. 

Iser (2008) suggests, rather, that the reader plays an active role in the process of understanding. The text, which is fixed, is compared to the stars, and the reader connects the lines, which are variable, in order to create a constellation. Whilst this idea is certainly more appealing to a reader wanting to have a more active role in the reading process, there are still some inherent difficulties for the feminist reader (or any reader whose subject position is dissimilar from that of the theorists).

As Schweickart (2008) notes, hopefully one day the social landscape will permit theory that presumes equality amongst readers, the current situation unfortunately is not so, and therefore, there cannot be a theory that encompasses all readers. There is no universal reader, and the fact that theory often overlooks this demonstrates the position of privilege from which many of the theorists wrote. As Schweickart (2008) notes, universal and male have been conflated, putting the feminist reader in a difficult situation.

As she reads, she is required to work against herself. This, Fetterly (1979) terms as 'immasculation' (p.xx).‘immasculation’ and it occurs in two ways as the feminist reader puts herself into the male protagonist subject position. Firstly, she does not see her own point of view represented in art, and thus suffers from a lack of legitimization, and secondly, she is required to constantly read against herself. This reading against herself occurs as she simultaneously identifies with the male protagonist, and others herself. For ‘to be male - to be universal -.. is to be *not female*’ (Fetterley, 1978, p.xx).

However, the solution to this issue is not to avoid reading, or avoid reading andocentric texts. It would be counter-productive to exclude the reading of texts written by males, and as Schweickart (2008) contends, there must be a way to understand and actively read these texts without undergoing the process of immasculation. There are texts, written by men, that despite having undergone thorough criticism, still evoke a certain emotional response from the reader. The feminist reader is aware of the ideology within the texts, she knows that the text is asking her to work against herself, and yet, the text still holds a certain appeal. Schweickart (2008) notes that this is not true for all texts, but for some. Rosen (2003) suggests that it is often within erotic texts that this occurs. So how can the active feminist reader approach these texts?

Schweickart (2008) proposes a bifurcated hermeneutic. The feminist reader, while reading, asks herself where the text gets its power to draw us in? Where does the irresistible power of these texts lie? Schweickart (2008) suggests that it is often the autonomous, active, desiring male subject who strenghtens the female desire for autonomy and love. 

In this case, the reader can carry out the dual hermeneutic. That is, she can identify that the subject is male, it discloses complicity with patriarchal ideology, this is the negative hermeneutic. The positive hermeneutic aims to recuperate the authentic kernel of emotional power that is inherent in the text. It tries to reach the heart of the text, to uncover the emotional power that draws the reader in.
