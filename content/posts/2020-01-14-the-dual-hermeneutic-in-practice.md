In the previous post, I looked, very briefly, at Schweickart's bifurcated hermeneutic for feminist readers interested in reading androcentric texts. (Schweickart mentions that this hermeneutic can be used for female authored texts that are imbued with counter-productive ideology in her footnotes - an interesting point that is certainly worth further probing!) In this post, however, I would like to attempt to put this hermeneutic into practice. Is it possible to uncover the authentic kernel of the text without othering oneself in the reading process? Schweickart (2008) mentions the episode of sexual awakening in Joyce's Portrait of an Artist. This scene holds undeniable emotion for any reader. However, as we discussed in the previous post, there cannot (at least for now), be a universal reader. However, most would agree that there are emotions that are not limited to gender, that are encompassed in what it means to be human. Can the reader, regardless of gender, access these emotions without immasculating herself. Again, I reiterate that my primary concern here is that of the feminist reader. This is not to discount other reading positions, but simply to outline the fact that there is not one type of universal, ungendered, unraced, neutrally positioned socially and historically reader. Whilst this may be a possibility in the future, it seems unlikely.
