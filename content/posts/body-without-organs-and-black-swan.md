We have an essay due for our critical theory module this semester and I've chosen a topic that looks at deconstruction.

This is the title:

_The idea of the self as a fixed entity is challenged by deconstruction and poststructural feminism. Explore the potential offered by the fragmentation of the self via discussion of these theories._

For a separate module we had studied The Body without Organs (Deleuze and Guattari ) and I knew that I somehow wanted to incorporate this into my essay on poststructuralism.

So I decided to find a link between Derrida and Deleuze and Guattari.  I suggested, in my essay, that Derrida, through the process of deconstruction, dismantles binaries that are generally taken for granted (good vs evil, angelic vs demonic etc) which allows for disparate ideas and concepts to be connected in new ways in order to create meaning. Similarly, for Deleuze and Guattari, there is no unified self, no 'center' of self. The process of becoming and of creating meaning is rhizomatic. For both theories, a unified center is rejected.

Braidotti () suggests that the process of becoming within the realm of poststructuralist feminism is, by definition, the creation of an alternative desire. It is not based on lacking, but it is generated by creative and productive forces.
