Hi and welcome to London & Newcastle!

I've been working on my undergraduate thesis, and I got chatting to my supervisor about academic blogs. She was saying that reliable academic blogs are certainly a good source, and it's important for Academia in general to remain up to date with changes in technology. Of course, this is not to say that journals, books, and printed articles are going to be replaced, but simply that academic blogs can also be useful. 

The blogs I came across in my own research were thought provoking and well written, and I used them as sources in a list of varied and reliable references. This got me to thinking that maybe some of my research or thoughts on certain topics could be of use to someone else. Even if simply to spark an idea or aid in the search for reliable references. 

So in the hope that maybe someone, someday, will find my work useful, I started this blog.  
  
I hope you enjoy!
