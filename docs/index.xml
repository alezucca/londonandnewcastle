      <description>Welcome to London &amp;amp; Newcastle
A blog dedicated to literature, critical theory, and all things academic.
My name is Alessia Zuccarelli and I am an Arts student at WIT in Waterford, Ireland. I&amp;rsquo;m majoring in English with Religion as my minor.
The purpose of this blog is to aid me in developing my thoughts around topics that I&amp;rsquo;m interested in or working on. Hopefully, it will be of help to someone doing research in a similar area.</description>
