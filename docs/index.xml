      <title>W.D. Snodgrass and Schweickart&#39;s Dual Hermeneutic</title>

      <description>In my last post, I briefly examined Schweickart’s dual hermeneutic that can be applied to androcentric texts. In today’s post, I want to apply that theory to a cycle of confessional poetry by W.D. Snodgrass. This poetry is not usually considered to be ideologically problematic, particularly because confessional poetry links the speaker of the poem and the poet so closely and because the emotional anguish and vulnerability of the poetry tend to lead the reader to believe that this poetry speaks to a universal human condition.</description>

      <description>Elaine Showalter argues for &amp;lsquo;gynocriticism&amp;rsquo; - that is, a form of literary criticism that enables women to read and analyze writing written by women. It is &amp;lsquo;genuinely woman-centered, independent, and intellectually coherent&amp;rsquo; (Showalter 1981, p.183). Whilst this is undeniably fundamental to recognizing the role of women&amp;rsquo;s writing to the literary canon, Schweickart (2008) makes a persuasive case for the creation of a literary technique that allows women to read andocentric texts as well.</description>

      <description>For my dissertation for my undergraduate degree, I decided to look into South African films. I chose Sink (Innes 2015) and Tsotsi (Fudakowski 2005). Sink is a relatively recent, independent film that revolves around 2 female protagonists, while Tsotsi is a mainstream film that won an Academy Award in 2005 and a Golden Globe in 2006.
Before I began my research, I watched as many South African films as I could, including Noem My Skollie, Dis Ek Anna, Ayanda, to name a few.</description>

      <description>We have an essay due for our critical theory module this semester and I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen a topic that looks at deconstruction.
This is the title:
The idea of the self as a fixed entity is challenged by deconstruction and poststructural feminism. Explore the potential offered by the fragmentation of the self via discussion of these theories.
For a separate module we had studied The Body without Organs (Deleuze and Guattari 2004) and I knew that I somehow wanted to incorporate this into my essay on poststructuralism.</description>

      <description>Hi and welcome to London &amp;amp; Newcastle!
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on my undergraduate thesis, and I got chatting to my supervisor about academic blogs. She was saying that reliable academic blogs are certainly a good source, and it&amp;rsquo;s important for Academia in general to remain up to date with changes in technology. Of course, this is not to say that journals, books, and printed articles are going to be replaced, but simply that academic blogs can also be useful.</description>

      <description>Welcome to London &amp;amp; Newcastle
A blog dedicated to literature, critical theory, and all things academic.
My name is Alessia Zuccarelli and I am an Arts student at WIT in Waterford, Ireland. I&amp;rsquo;m majoring in English with Religion as my minor.
The purpose of this blog is to aid me in developing my thoughts around topics that I&amp;rsquo;m interested in or working on. Hopefully, it will be of help to someone doing research in a similar area.</description>
