        <p>What is maternal subjectivity?</p>

<p>This is the question that led me into a rabbit hole of research that took me in surprising and unexpected directions, and which resulted in an undergraduate dissertation that I am really proud of!</p>

<p>My first interaction with maternal subjectivity was <em>Maternal Encounters</em>, by Lisa Baraitser. On page 6 Baraitser writes the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we shift from a female subject position to encompass a maternal one when we have a child (be that an adoptive, birth, foster, community or surrogate child, or any other relationship in which one comes to name another as one’s child), then we must surely contend with the notion that motherhood produces something new.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was this &lsquo;something new&rsquo; that interested me. I had just become a mother myself - I knew firsthand that motherhood changes, and importantly, complicates subjectivity. I knew that pregnancy was a shift in subjectivity, that although created a new life, also &lsquo;othered&rsquo; me in my own body. It was an ambiguous time that I found hard to process and hard to explain. Which is why Baraitser&rsquo;s study caught my eye.</p>

<p>On page 57, Baraitser examines the way in which the role of the mother has been &lsquo;plundered for metaphorical significance&rsquo; in traditional psychoanalytic research, and what is left is merely a shell. Plato&rsquo;s &lsquo;chora&rsquo; (Baraitser 2008, p.51).</p>

<p>Baraister examines interruption, unification, and emotional responses. All evoked by motherhood. On page 58 she writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the face of the infant’s needs, a mother may struggle with feelings of shame, confusion, self-reproach and anger when she feels anything other than being nourished and sustained by her maternal work. This struggle to own and embrace the full range of maternal reactions is always present. Although it may be tempting to think of the mother as she who has a tendency to persevere in the face of interruption, it seems important to resist this romanticization. We need to confront the possibility of the mother’s right of refusal, of her retaliation or even her breakdown.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is the rejection of the romantic image of mother that interests me. Mother is not only she who loves and nurtures. Mother is simultaneously she who loves, but also she who struggles, who resists, who experiences her own full range of emotions; both positive and negative.</p>

<p>The matrixial allows for this. It understands &lsquo;jointness-in-separateness&rsquo; (Ettinger 2006, p.4); it understands that two beings can fully exist, with their own subjectivities, while being connected with &lsquo;Other&rsquo;. It is a complicated framework to understand and to work with, and in all honesty it took months of research before I felt confident to attempt to apply it practically, but the potential it has in understanding human subjectivity, in my opinion, is limitless.</p>

<p>I am hesitant to attempt to simplify, recap, or summarize in any way. Instead, I will, over the course of the next blog posts, share some of the research I did with regards to the matrixial.</p>
