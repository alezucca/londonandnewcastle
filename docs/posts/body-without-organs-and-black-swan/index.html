<p>We have an essay due for our critical theory module this semester and I&rsquo;ve chosen a topic that looks at deconstruction.</p>

<p>This is the title:</p>

<p><em>The idea of the self as a fixed entity is challenged by deconstruction and poststructural feminism. Explore the potential offered by the fragmentation of the self via discussion of these theories.</em></p>

<p>For a separate module we had studied The Body without Organs (Deleuze and Guattari 2004) and I knew that I somehow wanted to incorporate this into my essay on poststructuralism.</p>

<p>So I decided to find a link between Derrida and Deleuze and Guattari.  I suggested, in my essay, that Derrida (2008), through the process of deconstruction, dismantles binaries that are generally taken for granted (good vs evil, angelic vs demonic etc) which allows for disparate ideas and concepts to be connected in new ways in order to create meaning. Similarly, for Deleuze and Guattari (2004), there is no unified self, no &lsquo;center&rsquo; of self. The process of becoming and of creating meaning is rhizomatic. For both theories, a unified center is rejected.</p>

<p>Braidotti (2002) suggests that the process of becoming within the realm of poststructuralist feminism is, by definition, the creation of an alternative desire. It is not based on lacking, but it is generated by creative and productive forces.</p>

<p>The fragmentation of self is a recurring theme in Aronofsky&rsquo;s 2010 production of <em>Black Swan</em>. Nina, played by Natalie Portman, is constantly portrayed in terms of contrast and of binaries. She wears dark colours, or she wears light colours, she is the Black Swan or she is the White Swan. And yet, even in these scenes we see one side of her crossing over, or bleeding into the other. For example, when Thomas tries to kiss her, she bites him on the lip, convincing him that she has the darkness inside of her to perform the role of the Black Swan.</p>

<p>The mirrors and lighting reemphasize this point over and over. By the end of the film, Nina has broken down the categories that previously define her, and by so doing, accesses new intensities. The fragmentation of self is what create meaning for her and allow her to experience her body and its potential in new ways, with an inhibition she is previously unable to experience (this is particularly evident in her sexual encounter with Lily, her &lsquo;evil&rsquo; double).</p>

<p>This is what I wrote regarding the Body without Organs:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Through a rejection of structure and unity, Nina is able to access new intensities, new connections. She is able to abandon structures of rigidity, power, and dominance, and open herself up to new movement and flows of emotion. The Deleuzoguattarian concept of the Body without the Organs, similarly to deconstruction, aims to ‘counteract philosophical prejudice in favour of unity, closure and homogeneity over diversity, openness and heterogeneity’ (Patton and Protevi 2003, p.4). The transformation that Nina’s body undergoes demonstrates the potential of the Body without Organs. This body is not a dead body, but a body ‘full of gaiety, ecstasy, and dance’ (Deleuze and Guattari 2004, p.167), it has discarded organisation and structure, and is thus able to reinterpret desire and create new connections and experience intensities.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Deleuze and Guattari say about this body: ‘You never reach the Body without Organs, you can’t reach it, you are forever attaining it, it is a limit’ (Deleuze and Guattari 2004, p.166).</p>

<p>The Body without Organs is created through experimentation and through exploration of what the body can do. It is done by destratifying the self, by enabling intensities to pass across the body, by abandoning psychoanalytical attempts to create a single, unified center, or self (Deleuze and Guattari 2004).</p>

<p>But this destratification is a risky process. It must be done with ‘injections of caution’ (Deleuze and Guattari 2004, p.167). It is a delicate process that, if done recklessly, can result in &lsquo;suicidal collapse&rsquo; (p.178). The final scene, the performance that results in Nina&rsquo;s physical death, demonstrates the danger inherent in this body, and in the intensities that it permits.</p>

<p>An interesting discussion, and possibly for a separate post is the &lsquo;body horror&rsquo; element of the film (Shaviro 2011). The liquid body and its link to poststructural feminism is a particularly fascinating one, and one that I&rsquo;d like to look into when I have the time.</p>
