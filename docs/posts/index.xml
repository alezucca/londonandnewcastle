      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finally managed to get my first episode up and running on Apple Podcasts and Stitcher. Click here for more.
The sound in the first two episodes isn&amp;rsquo;t great but hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to sort that out in the next ones!</description>

      <description>For my dissertation for my undergraduate degree, I decided to look into South African films. I chose Sink (Innes 2015) and Tsotsi (Fudakowski 2005). Sink is a relatively recent, independent film that revolves around 2 female protagonists, while Tsotsi is a mainstream film that won an Academy Award in 2005 and a Golden Globe in 2006.
Before I began my research, I watched as many South African films as I could, including Noem My Skollie, Dis Ek Anna, Ayanda, to name a few.</description>

What is maternal subjectivity?
This is the question that led me into a rabbit hole of research that took me in surprising and unexpected directions, and which resulted in an undergraduate dissertation that I am really proud of!
My first interaction with maternal subjectivity was Maternal Encounters, by Lisa Baraitser. On page 6 Baraitser writes the following:
 If we shift from a female subject position to encompass a maternal one when we have a child (be that an adoptive, birth, foster, community or surrogate child, or any other relationship in which one comes to name another as oneâ€™s child), then we must surely contend with the notion that motherhood produces something new.</description>

      <description>As part of my undergraduate research I&amp;rsquo;ve written an article about cinema in South Africa and the important role it plays in shaping identity.
This was for an interdisciplinary seminar, and alongside this piece I wrote an academic essay as well. I have done a lot of research into cinema and representation on the big screen this year, and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to do more research in this area once I&amp;rsquo;ve graduated.</description>

      <description>We have an essay due for our critical theory module this semester and I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen a topic that looks at deconstruction.
This is the title:
The idea of the self as a fixed entity is challenged by deconstruction and poststructural feminism. Explore the potential offered by the fragmentation of the self via discussion of these theories.
For a separate module we had studied The Body without Organs (Deleuze and Guattari 2004) and I knew that I somehow wanted to incorporate this into my essay on poststructuralism.</description>

      <description>Hi and welcome to London &amp;amp; Newcastle!
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on my undergraduate thesis, and I got chatting to my supervisor about academic blogs. She was saying that reliable academic blogs are certainly a good source, and it&amp;rsquo;s important for Academia in general to remain up to date with changes in technology. Of course, this is not to say that journals, books, and printed articles are going to be replaced, but simply that academic blogs can also be useful.</description>
