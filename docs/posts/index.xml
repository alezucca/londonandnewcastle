      <description>We have an essay due for our critical theory module this semester and I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen a topic that looks at deconstruction.
This is the title:
The idea of the self as a fixed entity is challenged by deconstruction and poststructural feminism. Explore the potential offered by the fragmentation of the self via discussion of these theories.
For a separate module we had studied The Body without Organs (Deleuze and Guattari 2004) and I knew that I somehow wanted to incorporate this into my essay on poststructuralism.</description>

      <description>Hi and welcome to London &amp;amp; Newcastle!
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on my undergraduate thesis, and I got chatting to my supervisor about academic blogs. She was saying that reliable academic blogs are certainly a good source, and it&amp;rsquo;s important for Academia in general to remain up to date with changes in technology. Of course, this is not to say that journals, books, and printed articles are going to be replaced, but simply that academic blogs can also be useful.</description>
