        <p>For my dissertation for my undergraduate degree, I decided to look into South African films. I chose <em>Sink</em> (Innes 2015) and <em>Tsotsi</em> (Fudakowski 2005). Sink is a relatively recent, independent film that revolves around 2 female protagonists, while Tsotsi is a mainstream film that won an Academy Award in 2005 and a Golden Globe in 2006.</p>

<p>Before I began my research, I watched as many South African films as I could, including <em>Noem My Skollie, Dis Ek Anna, Ayanda</em>, to name a few. I would have liked to watch more, but I found that the number of movies that were available overseas was frustratingly limited. After watching these, plus the two that I eventually ended up writing on, I knew that I wanted to examine the role of the mother. (See previous post)</p>

<p>I was particularly interested in Miriam (Terry Pheto) in <em>Tsotsi</em> and Rachel (Shoki Mokgapa) in <em>Sink</em>. (Interestingly, both have names from the Hebrew Bible, an aspect I would&rsquo;ve liked to investigate further, but didn&rsquo;t end up having space for in my word count). But what stood out most was the way neither of these women adhered, in any way, to the Angel of the House dichotomy that is so prevalent in Western literature.</p>

<p>Again, limited by time restraints, and to a certain extent access to resources, I was unable to investigate the role of women in South African film in depth. According to Balseiro and Masilela (2003), studies in the area mostly concentrate on how women are represented by both women and men, and how female directors present women. Furthermore, these studies have concentrated on the domination of black female bodies by both white men, and black men who have been emasculated by white society.</p>

<p>I wanted to approach this research in a different way. I wanted to take a new critical lens, and I wanted to examine the way in which these female relationships can be analyzed in this context.</p>

<p>This is where the Matrixial Borderspaces came in.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in my previous post, I am hesitant to attempt to summarize the concept as it defies simplification. In the next post, I will share a small excerpt from my dissertation that I believe exemplifies the potential of the matrixial.</p>
