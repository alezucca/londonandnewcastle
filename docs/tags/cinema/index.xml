      <description>For my dissertation for my undergraduate degree, I decided to look into South African films. I chose Sink (Innes 2015) and Tsotsi (Fudakowski 2005). Sink is a relatively recent, independent film that revolves around 2 female protagonists, while Tsotsi is a mainstream film that won an Academy Award in 2005 and a Golden Globe in 2006.
Before I began my research, I watched as many South African films as I could, including Noem My Skollie, Dis Ek Anna, Ayanda, to name a few.</description>
